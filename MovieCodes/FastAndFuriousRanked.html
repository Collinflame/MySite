            <h3>My Review: "7.5/10. This is just Avengers: Infinity War. It's the first part of a grand finale of an epic (or for F&F not so epic) saga.
                It has the villain that has been plotting since a very early movie and has a lot of scenes that should've killed the characters.
                However, unlike Infinity War, these characters don't have powers or futuristic gear. Instead, they only survive because of faith and family.
                They seemingly killed half the crew but considering Gisele is not really dead I'm just going to assume they all lived.
                The plot is absolutely ridiculous with a crazy amount of plot holes. The only great part about it is Jason Momoa as Dante.
                I was hoping that they will raise the stakes and the quality. Instead, they only raised the stakes."</h3>

                After watching it I only know three things about this movie. I know Roman and Tej went to space, that John Cena was in it and that Cardi B was in it.
                This is also now the 7th Fast and Furious movie I gave a 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9. My point is that they are all the damn same. Just one more movie and I can
                be done with this franchise. That is until Fast 11 comes out."</h3>
